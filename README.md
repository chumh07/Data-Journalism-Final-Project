# Data-Driven Story Pitch: The Benifits of Free/ Reduced School Meals  
###### By Hanh Chu
## Pitch Summary 
President Joe Biden signed a new bill, the Keep Kids Fed Act, into law on June 22, 2022. This law will extend most of the federal waivers that helped millions of kids around the United States get access to meals during the school years and summer just before their expiration at the end of the month. But this new law does not extend the waiver that made all school meals free to students regardless of their family’s income. 

The National Lunch Program provides free lunch for students with a family’s income at or below 130 percent of the Federal poverty line. This still leaves students at between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line with reduced costs of 40 cents for lunch and 30 cents for breakfast and above 180 percent with full-priced meals. These costs can add up and potentially burden families. 

I want to use data to explore more about the benefits of the National Lunch Program and whether or not it should expand the requirement on household income for students to receive free meals.

This pitch was inspired by [this article by NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/free-school-lunches-are-ending-house-passes-deal-summer-meals-child-nu-rcna34745). This project was made possible with the data from the California Department of Education's [website](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sh/cw/), the table from [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/aspe-files/107166/2020-percentage-poverty-tool.pdf), and table A1 and table A2 from the [Income and Poverty in the United States: 2020 report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html)  by the United States Census Bureau.    

### Potential Interview Contacts
1. Ms. Cathy Ahearn 
- Email: cahearn@slcusd.org
- As a teacher working closely with second English language learners and low- income students, she understands and is familiar with the needs of the communities
- with the most participation in the National Lunch Program.

2. Ashley Salomon Gaspar
- Email: ashleyswoo@gmail.com
- She received school meals through the National School Program from K-12 and she can provide a personal experience with the pros and cons of the program. 

### Potential Additional Sources
1. [Children's Food Security and Intakes from School Meals: Final Report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/84357/ccr-61.pdf?v=4652.4)
- This study shows the relations between food security and nutrition in children in relation to school meals. 
- It could help us understand more about the role of school meals in increasing food security and daily nutrition intake across the income threshold in children. This can show how increasing the accessibility to school meals can benefit children. 

2. [The Food and Nutrition Assistance Landscape: Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/101909/eib-227.pdf?v=7735.7)
- This study summarizes all of the federal programs aiming at providing food accessibility. 
- This can help understand the funding and expenses going into increasing food security across the country. We can analyze the trends and compare its effect on the well-being of children in the U.S.


## Data Analysis Process
The first step of my analysis was to clean the data using the program Refine. After inspection, I only catch some spelling errors in the school’s name and the rest of the data did not require any refining. 
The next step is to rename the data sets, bold, and freeze the heading row after uploading them onto Google Sheets. 

### Key Assumptions 
All questions were answered using the data set for the year 2020 from the sources mentioned above. 

### Analysis 
1. What is the amount of students erolling in the National School Program in each school type?
