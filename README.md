# Data-Driven Story Pitch: The Benifits of Free/ Reduced School Meals  
###### By Hanh Chu
## Pitch Summary 
President Joe Biden signed a new bill, the Keep Kids Fed Act, into law on June 22, 2022. This law will extend most of the federal waivers that helped millions of kids around the United States get access to meals during the school years and summer just before their expiration at the end of the month. But this new law does not extend the waiver that made all school meals free to students regardless of their family’s income. 

The National Lunch Program provides free lunch for students with a family’s income at or below 130 percent of the Federal poverty line. This still leaves students at between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line with reduced costs of 40 cents for lunch and 30 cents for breakfast and above 180 percent with full-priced meals. These costs can add up and potentially burden families. 

I want to use data to explore more about the benefits of the National Lunch Program and whether or not it should expand the requirement on household income for students to receive free meals.
